        <h2 class="start" id="start">The Start of it All</h2>
        <p>When I was 17 I was sitting in school one day listening to some of my favorite music and thought to myself, hey I just got a laptop for christmas. So when I got home that day I downloaded GarageBand and invited my friend over who made music. We instantly started making a beat from scratch and the rest was history from there. Out came Mattress, my first song as a sophmore in Highschool.</p>

        <h2 class="after">After Mattress</h2>
        <p>I went on to make more choppy low quality little rap songs like Just let me know, and GO! After these songs I took a long break untill after highschool when I moved to Eau Claire and started taking music seriously.</p>

        <h2 class="after"> The YLIFE Phase</h2>
        <p>For almost a year I was making bouncy hyperpop music under the name of YLIFE. I ended up becoming very unhappy with the music I was creating so I decided to delete all traces of me and take a break for 8 months. I came back strong under with a song called Pac-Man under the new name 6ierce, making hiphop/ rap music  </p>

        <h2 class="after">6ierce the new me</h2>
        <p>After moving past YLIFE and the things I was going through at the time I finally got back into my music but with a new relaxed and happy rap flow. This change came because its what I truly enjoy to make and its what speaks to me.</p>
