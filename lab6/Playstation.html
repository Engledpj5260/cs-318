    <h2>Pros</h2>
    <h3>Specs</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>SSD offers 825GB, but only up to 700GB of that is available to the user.  It runs quicker though, up to 5.5GB/s</li>
        <li>4K Ultra HD Blu-ray drives</li>
        <li>The PlayStation 5 has access to the three tiers of PlayStation Plus that Sony relaunched in 2022, which includes a range of cloud streaming games that you can access. It is not as fully formed as Xbox's offering and is only available on PlayStation consoles and through a PC app</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Games</h3>
    <p>The PlayStation 5 edges ahead for us when it comes to the games available on each console - where the difference really comes down to exclusives. A Call of Duty release or the latest sports title from EA will play almost identically on both, but exclusive titles are different. In Sony's corner, you have the likes of God of War, Marvel's Spider-Man, Horizon Forbidden West and Returnal to sink into, with a range of top PS4 exclusives also looking better than ever on the newer hardware. This means you have a hit-list of classics to enjoy.</p>
    <h3>Price</h3>
    <p>The Playstation 5 is $650</p>
