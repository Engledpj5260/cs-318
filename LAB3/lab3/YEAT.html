            <p>For California-bred, Portland-based rapper YEAT, creating infectious melodies has always seemed to come naturally.</p>
            <h2>Before Fame</h2>
            <p>Destined for a career in music, it’s no surprise that YEAT’s knack for sugary, auto-tuned verses has allowed him to flourish over the last two years. Releasing two albums in 2021 thus far, his most recent effort, 4L, fully immerses listeners into his unique style — embodying the new wave’s signature, rowdy sound in the process.
                Stoking the flames of the fire the Soundcloud era ignited, the underground rising star stirs up rap circles by continuing to shape excitement around his future releases. Teasing his upcoming album Up To Me, YEAT had more in store for fans beforehand by dropping a 4-track EP, Trëndi.</p>
