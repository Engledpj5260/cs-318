                 <h1>Our Story</h1>
                 <p>The Galloping Goose was established in 1873 by my
                    great-grandmother, Marike. She inherited from her father
                    a 23 acre apple orchard and his prized goose Gertrude at
                    the age of 16. In the beginning she would sell cider and
                    pies on the edge of town to the villagers. Eventually she
                    saved enough turn the farmhouse at the end of her land
                    into The Galloping Goose. Over the last century The
                    Galloping Goose has been handed down to the eldest
                    daughter who keeps the legacy of the pub alive.</p>
